# Robot-arm-Matlab-simulation & Tangram-recognition

Hi, there. I am Zhiyu Wang, this project is graduation design for my bachlor's degree in Automation. It is finished at May, 2017, which is about 2 years ago. However, recently, I realized I didn't collect the source code well. Then I decided to use some of my spare time to recollect and rewrite some of the Matlab source code, and also write a readable introduction to this interesting project. Hopefully everyone could get what they want from it.<br />
From the title, it could be told obviously that this project consists of 2 parts, robot arm simulation, and multi-colored tangram recognition. So 2 fields are covered here, robot arm control and simulation and also computer vision. Specially, I constructed a 6 axis robot arm module by using toolboxes released by Prof.Peter Corke. Besides that, the recognition part is accomplished with a traditional ROI extraction and analysis way. Basically, trangrams are recognized by their color information, also I am working on solve the problem with a ML way recently.<br />
Now let's officially start introducing.

## Getting Started

Best reference for this project is the book written by Prof.Peter Corke, <br /><Robotics, Vision and Control Fundamental algorithms in Matlab> https://www.amazon.com/Robotics-Vision-Control-Fundamental-Algorithms/dp/3642201431.<br />
Also all the information could also be found at Prof.Peter Corke's personal website. http://petercorke.com/wordpress/.

### Prerequisites

Installing the Toolboxes:<br />

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
