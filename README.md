# robot-arm-simulation-tangram-recognition
This is the code set of my graduate project <Tangram recognition and catching simulation with robot arm>.
 In this code set, there are two main parts.
 First part is about the construction of a 6 axis robot arm. I studied the toolbox relesed by Prof.Peter Corke.
 By runing the main.m file, you can get a robot arm model like the picture below.
